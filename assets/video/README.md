# Hero Video Asset

## Required Video

Place your hero video here as `hero.mp4`

### Specifications:
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Max size**: 2MB
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **Content**: Restaurant atmosphere, food preparation, dining experience, or opening night footage

### Also Required:
Place a fallback image as `fallback.jpg` for users with:
- Reduced motion preferences enabled
- Browsers that don't support video autoplay
- Slow connections

### Current Status:
⚠️ **TODO**: Add your hero video file here to complete the homepage hero section.

The homepage will gracefully fall back to the static image at `/assets/img/restaurant_crowded_w_99428610.jpg` until the video is added.

### Tips:
- Compress your video to stay under 2MB (use tools like HandBrake or online compressors)
- Ensure the video loops seamlessly (start and end frames should match)
- Test with sound off (video plays muted by default)
- Consider using services like Cloudinary or Vimeo for video hosting to save bandwidth
